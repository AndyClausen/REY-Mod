<b><color=green>.:: GENERAL INFORMATION ::.</color></b>
The idea behind this modkit was to make the game more of a challenge, force collaborations, keep early-game specialties relevant in late-game, and at the same time add a bit of realism to it. The key is to work together or else you won't succeed in shooting down the meteor in time.
